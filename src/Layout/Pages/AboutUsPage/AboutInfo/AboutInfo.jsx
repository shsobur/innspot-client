                  <b>The United Nations</b> is an international organization founded in
                  <b>1945</b>. Currently made up of 193 <u>Member States</u>, the <u>UN and its
                  work</u> are guided by the purposes and principles contained in
                  its founding Charter.<br/> The UN has evolved over the years to
                  keep pace with a rapidly changing world. But one thing has
                  stayed the same: it remains the one place on Earth where all
                  the world’s nations can gather together, discuss common
                  problems, and find shared solutions that benefit all of
                  humanity. The <u>Secretary-General</u> is Chief Administrative
                  Officer of the UN – and is also a symbol of the Organization's
                  ideals and an advocate for all the world's peoples, especially
                  the poor and vulnerable.<br/><br/> The Secretary-General is appointed by
                  the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security
                  Council for a 5-year, renewable term. The current
                  Secretary-General, and the 9th occupant of the post, is
                  António Guterres of Portugal, who took office on 1 January
                  2017. On the 18th of June, 2021, Guterres was re-appointed to
                  a second term, pledging as his priority to continue helping
                  the world chart a course out of the <b>COVID-19</b> pandemic.<br/><br/>
